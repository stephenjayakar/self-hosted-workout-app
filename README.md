# Summary

I didn't really like using existing workout apps for a couple of reasons:
* Lack of flexibility. I feel like apps heavily bias towards routines, and sometimes I just want to do my own exercises + mix and match things.
* Ads or some type of monetisation strategy. Don't like that
* Weird UX experiences.

# Architecture

I'm using Convex lol. ignore the server folder for now.
